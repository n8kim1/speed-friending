Input: a csv. The first row lists all members of Section 1, separated by commas; the second row lists all members of Section 2, separated by commas. 

Each of the next rows (if any) represents a group that has already happened, and lists all people in that group. For example, consider that there has so far been one round: a pair of people (A and B) in one group, and a triple (C, D, and E) in another. The rows should be ```A,B``` and ```C,D,E```
